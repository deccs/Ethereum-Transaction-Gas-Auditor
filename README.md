## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üìä Transaction Data Fetching:** Retrieves transaction details (`eth_getTransactionByHash`) and receipts (`eth_getTransactionReceipt`)
- **üî¨ Debug Trace Analysis:** Fetches detailed execution traces using `debug_traceTransaction` with both:
  - `callTracer` for call flow and gas usage per call
  - `structLog` for step-by-step opcode execution, frequency, and errors
- **üìà Gas Efficiency Scoring:** Calculates a heuristic-based score (0-100) indicating potential gas inefficiencies
- **üí° Optimization Suggestions:** Provides actionable suggestions based on the analysis results
- **üíæ BigQuery Caching:** Stores transaction data for faster future retrievals
- **üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface:** User-friendly React frontend to input transaction hashes and view results
- **üîÑ Trace Fallback:** Offers the best available analysis based on available trace types

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.10+
- Django 5+
- `requests` for RPC calls
- `google-cloud-bigquery` for BigQuery interaction
- `python-dotenv` for environment variable management
- `django-cors-headers` for Frontend communication (primarily useful if running frontend dev server separately)
- `whitenoise` for serving static files

### Frontend
- React 18+ (with TypeScript)
- Vite (Build tool)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- `axios` (or similar for API calls)

### Database
- SQLite (Default for Django development - admin/auth)
- Google BigQuery (For caching transaction data)

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.10 or higher
- **pip:** Python package installer
- **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher
- **npm:** Node package manager (or yarn/pnpm)
- **Git:** For cloning the repository

### Google Cloud Platform Requirements

- **GCP Account** with a project created
- **BigQuery API** enabled for the project
- **Blockchain Node Engine API** (or similar, depending on the specific RPC endpoint used) enabled for the project
- **Service Account** with permissions:
  - BigQuery Data Editor (`roles/bigquery.dataEditor`)
  - BigQuery Metadata Viewer (`roles/bigquery.metadataViewer`)
  - BigQuery Job User (`roles/bigquery.jobUser`)
- **Service Account Key** downloaded in JSON format (store this securely, **outside** the repository)
- **API Key** (if required by your chosen GCP RPC endpoint)

### Google Cloud Blockchain RPC

- This project uses **Google Cloud's Blockchain Node Engine** or similar RPC service. [See Google Cloud Docs](https://cloud.google.com/blockchain-node-engine/docs)
- **Important:** Ensure your chosen RPC endpoint supports the `debug_traceTransaction` method. Public endpoints might have limitations. Consider using a dedicated node endpoint for full tracing capabilities.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deccs/Ethereum-Transaction-Gas-Auditor.git
cd Ethereum-Transaction-Gas-Auditor
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (Ethereum-Transaction-Gas-Auditor/) by copying the example below and filling in your actual values. Do NOT commit this file to Git.

```
# .env file content

# Django Settings
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="your_strong_random_secret_key_here" # Generate a secure random key
DJANGO_DEBUG="True"  # Set to "False" for production
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS="127.0.0.1,localhost" # Add your domain in production

# Google Cloud & BigQuery Settings
PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
DATASET_ID="your_bigquery_dataset_id" # e.g., eth_transactions
TABLE_ID="your_bigquery_table_id"     # e.g., transaction_cache

# Service Account JSON - Choose ONE option (Option 1 Recommended):
# Option 1: Path to the key file (Store the file OUTSIDE the project directory)
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON="/path/to/your/secure/location/service-account-key.json"
# Option 2: JSON content pasted directly (Less manageable, ensure proper quoting/escaping)
# SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type": "service_account", "project_id": "...", ...}'

# Google Cloud Blockchain RPC Endpoint
# Replace with your actual endpoint URL from GCP Blockchain Node Engine or other provider
# Example using Blockchain Node Engine (requires project setup and maybe API Key):
GCP_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://YOUR_REGION-eth-mainnet.blockchainnodeengine.googlecloudapis.com/?key=YOUR_API_KEY"
# Or a public endpoint (might have trace limitations):
# GCP_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
```

**Security Note:** Store your service-account-key.json file securely outside of your project directory and ensure the .env file is included in your .gitignore.

### 3. Backend Setup (Django)
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd eth_processor/eth_processor

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
# Using venv (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Using conda
# conda create -n gasauditor python=3.11
# conda activate gasauditor

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r ../requirements.txt # requirements.txt is one level up
```

### 4. Frontend Setup (React)
```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the project root
cd ../../bk-app  # Or `cd bk-app` if you are in the project root

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### 5. Build Frontend Assets
```bash
# Still in the bk-app directory
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the bk-app/dist folder. Django will serve these files.

### 6. Initialize Backend Database
```bash
# Navigate back to the backend directory
cd ../eth_processor/eth_processor

# Activate your virtual environment if not already active
# source venv/bin/activate OR venv\Scripts\activate OR conda activate gasauditor

# Apply Django database migrations (for admin panel, auth, etc.)
python manage.py migrate
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

With the setup complete, Django will serve both the backend API and the built React frontend application.

**Ensure Frontend is Built:** You should have already run `npm run build` in the bk-app directory during setup (Step 5). If you make frontend changes, you'll need to run `npm run build` again.

**Start the Django Server:**

1. Navigate to the backend directory (Ethereum-Transaction-Gas-Auditor/eth_processor/eth_processor).

2. Activate your Python virtual environment (e.g., `source venv/bin/activate`).

3. Run the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will typically start on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. Keep this terminal running.

**Access the Application:**

Open your web browser and navigate to the address shown by the runserver command, usually:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Django serves the index.html from your bk-app/dist folder, and Whitenoise serves the associated CSS and JavaScript assets.

The React application should load. Enter a valid Ethereum transaction hash and click "Analyze Transaction". The frontend will make API calls to the backend (e.g., /api/transaction/) on the same host and port.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Input:** Transaction hash is entered in the React frontend.
2. **API Request:** Frontend sends a POST request to the Django backend API endpoint (e.g., /api/transaction/).
3. **Transaction Fetching:** Backend uses the configured RPC endpoint to retrieve transaction details and receipt.
4. **BigQuery Storage:** Data is formatted and stored/updated in the specified BigQuery table for caching.
5. **Trace Analysis:** If the transaction is confirmed (has a receipt), the backend attempts to fetch debug_traceTransaction data (both callTracer and default/structLog).
6. **Parsing & Scoring:** Traces are parsed, a gas efficiency score is calculated, and optimization suggestions are generated based on heuristics.
7. **Response:** A JSON object containing the fetched data, BigQuery confirmation, trace analysis, score, and suggestions is returned to the frontend.
8. **Display:** Frontend renders the transaction summary, BigQuery status, trace analysis details, score, and suggestions.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Analysis:** More sophisticated gas usage heuristics and pattern detection (e.g., identifying expensive loops, storage patterns).
- **Contract Code Context:** Integration with source code verification services (like Etherscan) to link analysis to specific code lines.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Abstract RPC/Chain details to easily support other EVM-compatible chains.
- **Historical Analytics:** Allow users to view and compare analyses for previously submitted transactions.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Implement charts for gas usage breakdown per call frame and visual call flow diagrams.
- **Better Error Handling:** Provide more specific user feedback for RPC errors, BigQuery issues, or parsing failures.
- **User Accounts:** Allow users to save their analyses or track specific contracts.
- **Containerization:** Add Docker configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml) for easier setup and deployment.
